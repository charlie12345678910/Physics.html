  <div class="box">An electronic doorbell has an inbuilt circutiry which produce a high monotone sound that acts as the sound for the doorbell when the switch is pressed. 
<p> The purpose of this website is to describe the mechanism of an electronic doorbell. The electronic components used for this experimentation were transistors,
speakers, jumper wires, breadboard, capacitors, switch and an amplifier circuit.<br>This doorbell used the concept of RC circuit using an Ac source When the switch was closed,
a sound is produced from the speaker as a result of the frequencies in the circuit and it served as an electronic doorbell.The work of the transistor was to amplify the current 
passing through the circuit by fluctuating the electrical pulses or currents.Thus, sound could be heard. The purpose of the resistor was to also help in the gradual charging and 
discharging of current in the capacitors as they stored charges. This generated frequency in the current and it was amplified by the transistors. When we connected our circuit to a DC source, 
it produced a sound with a low tone so in order to get a clearer sound we connected an Ac source and varied the frequencies across it. This gave us different sounds at the various frequencies.
Although sounds could be heard clearly from the speaker, we still connected an amplifying circuit to the main circuit and the sound increased</p>
